  "bio_text": "I’ve always been driven by a deep curiosity and a desire to explore different worlds. Sports are an essential part of my balance: whether it’s on a football field, in the gym, or during an intense training session, I find discipline, resilience, and energy that motivate me every day.<br/>Video games also play an important role in my life. Beyond entertainment, they have taught me patience, logic, and the ability to stay focused on a goal while enjoying the process of learning and improving.<br/>Programming naturally became part of this journey. I see it as the same dynamic: taking on challenges, building step by step, finding solutions, and seeing the concrete results of my work. Every line of code feels like a piece of a bigger picture that gradually takes shape.<br/>I chose this profession because development allows me to combine my passion for creating with my desire to make things simpler, more efficient, and more meaningful for others.<br/>Today, I put my expertise into projects that matter, with the ambition to keep learning, growing, and sharing what I love to do."
